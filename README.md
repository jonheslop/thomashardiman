This project uses https://www.11ty.dev/ and is running on [Zeit].

To add new work, you need to make a new [markdown] file in the [src/work](src/work) folder with the `.md` extension.

Any images should go in the [/img](/img) folder

For CSS we use Tachyons, the docs are here - http://tachyons.io/docs/

Every time you save a change, (in Git that is called a commit) Zeit will redeploy the website. There will be a 30 sec delay
